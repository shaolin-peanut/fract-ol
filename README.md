# Fract-ol
Learned a lot coding this project.
## Usage
1. In any linux or mac terminal, run `git clone this_repo_url`
2. When it's downloaded, go into the folder with `cd fractol`
3. Run `make` to compile the project
4. Run `./fractol` alone to see the options, then rerun it with one of the sets to explore it
- Ex: `./fractol julia`
