# Fract-ol
Learned a lot coding this project.
## Usage
In any linux or mac terminal, run `git clone this_repo_url`
When it's downloaded, go into the folder with `cd fractol`
Run `make` to compile the project
Run `./fractol` alone to see the options, then rerun it with one of the sets to explore it
Ex: `./fractol julia`
