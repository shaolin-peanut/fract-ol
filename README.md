# Fract-ol
Learned a lot coding this project.
## Usage
1. In any linux or mac terminal, run `git clone this_repo_url`
2. When it's downloaded, go into the folder with `cd fractol`
3. Run `make` to compile the project
4. Run `./fractol` alone to see the options, then rerun it with one of the sets to explore it
- Ex: `./fractol julia`

When running the julia set, the fractal will update as you move the mouse. If you it to stop moving (to zoom more easily for example), press the `SPACE` bar

If you're too lazy to install the program, here's a little demo:
